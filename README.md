# Computational-Electromagnetism

A jupyter notebook for the final project of the course Computational Electromagnetism. The project simulates food heating in a microwave cavity and measures the SAR. The cavity tha we used is the same as in the paper D.D.Dinƒçov,K.A.Parrott and K.A.Pericleous. Heat and mass transfer in two-phase porous materials under intensive microwave heating. Journal of Food Engineering. Volume 65, Issue 3, December 2004, Pages 403-412.
